EITI Peru Data Visualization APP
====

This app visualizes data fom EITI in Peru, but can be used for all other types of data vizualisation. EITI stands for  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).

**The data is pulled from a Google Spreadsheet, so non-techie persons can easily update and change data on the fly.** The app is fully responsive thanks to [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), which shows the visualiztion on all devices. 

It uses some standard visualization libraries such as [Google Visualization API](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and the [JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit](https://philogb.github.io/jit/index.html).
